Ishan Kishan became the most expensive buy this year after Mumbai Indians (MI) bought him for Rs 15.25 crore. Meanwhile, Avesh Khan also hit the limelight and became the most expensive uncapped cricketer in IPL auction history after he was picked for Rs 10 crore by Lucknow Super Giants.

Bowling all-rounder Deepak Chahar was also involved in an intense bidding war with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) eventually getting him for Rs 14 crore. Aussie opener David Warner was picked by Delhi Capitals (DC) for Rs 6.25 crore. The batter had a disappointing IPL 2021 season and was also stripped of SunRisers Hyderabad's (SRH) captaincy. He bounced back to good form soon and helped Australia win the T20 World Cup.</p>
